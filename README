#Description

This program is intended to be run on a Xilinix FPGA. Others may or may not work. This file size has been reduced to meet upload requirments.

This program uses the 7-segment LED display, button up, down, L, R, and the firt 15 switches on the FPGA. This program displays 0 and can increment
up to FFFF. The program increments by pressing the up (u) button and decrements by pressing the down (d) button. Additoinally, the counter will continuously
count up or down if the respective button is held down. While contiuously incrementing, the program will automatically stop at FFFC. 

The switches can be used to display a hexadecimal number ranging from 0 - FFFF. The load (L) button can be used to load an obtained value from the switches
on to the counter.

The reset button (R) will set each flip-flop to its default state.

If the counter has the value FFFF and is incremented once more, the counter will "wrap around," meaning the next value will be 0.
conversely, if the counter has the value 0 and is decremented, then the value displayed will be FFFF.

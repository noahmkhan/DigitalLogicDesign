# Description

This program uses a VGA monitor, button up (u), down (d), center (c), and reset (r). The player is displayed as a frog, or a white box, on the screen.
Button C is used to begin the game. Green boxes, or lilypads, will move towards the player. The player has the option to jump over the lilypad by pressing
U or dive underneath it by pressing D. The counter will increment each time the player successfully overcomes an obstacle.

The game will end when the player collides with the lilypad. Each lilypad will stop moving and the frog will blink. The game will restart when button R is pressed.

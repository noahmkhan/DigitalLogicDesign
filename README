# Description

This program was origanally intended to be used with IR sensors but has been modifed to use buttons in place of the sensors. Within the scope of this project,
A button being pushed down is the same as a senor being covered by an animal.

The hardware utilized for this project are the buttons left (L), right (R), and the 7-segment LED display. This program uses a state machine comprised
of 6 states and a 4-bit counter. The counter has the ability to increment and decrement. The counter only increments in the following scenario:

The left button is pushed and held down. Then, the right button is held down while the left button is still being held down. After, the left button
is released. Finally, the right button is released. This will cause the counter to count up.

Conversely, the counter will decrement in the following scenario:

The right button is pushed and held down. Then, the left button is held down while the right button is still being held down. After, the right button
is released. Finally, the left button is released. This will cause the counter to count down.

In both of these cases an animal has fully crossed the road.

In any other case, the counter will not change.
